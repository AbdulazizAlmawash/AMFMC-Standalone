# AMFMC: A Virtual A320 Flight Management Computer (FMC)

Welcome to the **Virtual A320 FMC** project! This is a work-in-progress application designed to simulate the functionality of an Airbus A320's Flight Management Computer (FMC) in a virtual environment. 
Built using **Unity** and **C#**, the goal is to create an interactive and customizable FMC experience for aviation enthusiasts and students.

## Important Note: Antivirus False Positives

üö® **Antivirus Alert**: Some antivirus programs may flag the `AMFMC.exe` or other files in this application as potentially harmful. 

This is a **false positive** caused by the way the app is packaged or how certain files are bundled. Rest assured, the app is safe to use if downloaded from this repository.

### What You Can Do:
- Add the app folder to your antivirus program's **exclusion list**.
- Verify the integrity of the files by ensuring you download only from the [official releases](https://github.com/FSGAM3R/AMFMC-Standalone/releases).
- Contact us if you have concerns or need further clarification.

I appreciate your understanding and am working to minimize such issues in future releases.
